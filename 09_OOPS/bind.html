<!-- 
    Here, bind() is used to set the value of this inside the handleClick method of the React class.

    =>> In JavaScript, this is a special keyword that refers to the current context. 
        However, its value can change depending on how a function is called. 
        Inside the event handler function handleClick(), this refers to the element that triggered the event, 
        which is the button element in this case.
    
    =>> However, within the handleClick method of the React class, 
        this is intended to refer to the instance of the React class itself. 
        But without using bind(), when the handleClick method is called as an event listener, 
        this would refer to the button element, not the React instance. 
        This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if you try to access properties or 
        methods of the React instance within handleClick.

    =>> To solve this problem and ensure that this refers to the React instance within the handleClick method, 
        the bind() method is used when adding the event listener:

        document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', this.handleClick.bind(this))

        ==> Here, this.handleClick.bind(this) creates a new function that, 
            when called, will execute the handleClick method of the React instance (this) and ensures that 
            this inside handleClick refers to the React instance, not the button element.

    
    ==>> So, when the button is clicked, the handleClick method of the React instance is invoked, 
         and within that method, this refers to the instance of the React class, 
         allowing access to its properties like this.server.
