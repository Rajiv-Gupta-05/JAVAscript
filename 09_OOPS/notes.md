## why use OOP?
  - It offers several benefits that make it a popular paradigm for software development:
  -> Modularity, Reusability, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
  - OOP provides a powerful and flexible way to organize and structure your code, making it easier to develop, maintain, and      extend complex software systems.

## parts of OOP
Object literal

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

## 4 Pillars of OOP
- Abstraction:- Representing only the essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details.
- Encapsulation:- Bundling data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) into a single unit (object or class) and restricting access to certain parts.
- Inheritance:- Allowing a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class, promoting code reuse and hierarchy.
- Polymorphism:- Objects of different types can be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling flexibility and extensibility in code.
