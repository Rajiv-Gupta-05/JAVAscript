<!--
    Lexical Scoping:
Lexical scoping refers to the way variable access is determined by the position of the variables 
within the nested structure of code blocks. In JavaScript, scope is defined during the lexing phase of code execution, 
which is why it's called lexical scoping.

    Key Points:
-> Scope Chain: Each function in JavaScript maintains a reference to its outer scope (lexical environment) where it was defined. 
   This forms a chain of scopes known as the scope chain.
-> Scope Resolution: When a variable is referenced, JavaScript looks up the scope chain starting 
   from the innermost scope (where the variable was referenced) and goes outward until it finds the variable declaration.
-> Function Scope: Variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function unless 
   they are explicitly passed to inner functions or returned from the outer function.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Closure:
A closure is a combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. 
It allows a function to access and manipulate variables from its outer scope 
even after the outer function has finished executing.

    Key Points:
-> Encapsulation: Functions in JavaScript carry their lexical environment with them, creating a closure. 
   This encapsulates variables within the function's scope, preventing them from being modified by external code.
-> Data Privacy: Closures provide a way to create private variables and functions 
   because the enclosed scope is not accessible from outside the function.
-> Maintaining State: Closures can be used to maintain state across multiple function calls, 
   as variables within the closure retain their values between calls.
